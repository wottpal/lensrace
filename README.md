## Development

When developing in VSCode it's recommended to open within the workspace file located at `.vscode/*.code-workspace`. Also, install recommended plugins listed in `.vscode/extensions.json`.

```bash
# Generate contract-types, start local hardhat node, and start frontend with turborepo
pnpm dev

# Only start frontend
pnpm frontend:dev
```
